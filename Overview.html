  <section class=comment>
   <p>One way to get started writing slides with the b6+ framework is
    to download the zip file <a href="slides.zip"
    >‘slides.zip’</a>. It contains everything you need, in particular
    the <a href="b6plus.js" >‘b6plus.js’</a> JavaScript file, two
    different style sheets, <a href="simple.css" >‘simple’</a>
    and <a href="style2.css" >‘style2’</a>,
    this <a href="Overview.html" >manual</a> (which uses the simple
    style) and a <a href="sample2.html" >sampler of style2</a>. You
    can use the manual and the sampler as examples, or make a copy of
    one or the other and change the contents to your liking.
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=intro1>
   <h1>What is b6+? (1/2)</h1>
   <p><a href="b6plus.js">b6plus.js</a> is a script (JavaScript) to
    show slides in a browser
    that does not have a paged mode. It is the successor
    to <a href="../b6/" >b6</a> and backwards compatible with it, and
    also provides some compatibility with <a href="https://shwr.me/"
    >Shower</a>. With some restrictions, style sheets written for
    Shower can be used with b6+.
   <p>Slides can be elements with <code>class=slide</code>, but can
    also just start with an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> (as in the
    old <a href="../#slidemaker" >Slidemaker</a>) or with an element
    with a <code>page-break-before: always</code> property (as for
    Opera until version 12).
   <p>The script handles the keyboard, mouse and
     gesture <a href="#navigation" >navigation.</a>
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=intro2>
   <h1>What is B6+? (2/2)</h1>
   <p>The first part below is the manual for the functionality
    provided by the script.

   <p>The script will work without any style sheet, but a style sheet
    may provide additional features.

   <p>The second part of the manual describes the features of the
    <a href="simple.css" >simple.css</a> style sheet (which is used for
    this manual).
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=structure>
   <h1>Document structure</h1>
   <p>B6+ works with documents in which slides are marked up in one of
    three ways:
   <ol>
    <li>each slide is enclosed in an element with <code>class=slide</code>, <em>or</em>
    <li>an element with <code>page-break-before: always</code> starts a slide, <em>or</em>
    <li>each slide starts with an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
   </ol>
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=script>
   <h1>The b6plus.js script</h1>
   <p>The script offers the following functions:
   <ul>
    <li>Swapping style sheets for screen and projection
    <li>Shower compatibility
    <li>Fixed aspect ratio or adaptive
    <li>Progress bar
    <li>Slide number &amp; count of slides
    <li>Incremental display of elements on a slide
    <li>Start either in index or in slide mode
    <li>Navigation with keyboard, mouse or gestures
    <li>Preview &amp; notes on a second screen
   </ul>
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=media>
   <h1>Screen and projection styles</h1>
   <p>Different styles can be applied in slide mode and in index
    mode. The media attribute determines what each style sheet is for.
   <ul>
    <li>media=screen indicates a style sheet for index mode:
     <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="screen"
     href=...&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;style
     media="screen"&gt;…&lt;/style&gt;</code>

    <li>media=projection or media="(overflow-block: paged)"
     indicates a style sheet for slide mode: <code>&lt;link
     rel="stylesheet" media="projection"
     href=...&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;style media="(overflow-block:
     paged)"&gt;…&lt;/style&gt;</code>. (‘projection’ is an
     old, but now deprecated media type.)
   </ul>
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=shower>
   <h1>Compatibility with Shower</h1>
   <p>B6+ implements a subset of <a href="https://shwr.me/"
     >Shower's</a> functionality:
   <ul>
    <li>Sets <code>class=full</code> on <code>&lt;body</code> in slide mode
    <li>Sets <code>class=active</code> on the currently displayed slide
    <li>Sets <code>class=visited</code> on slides that have been displayed
    <li>Sets <code>class=active</code> on incrementally displayed
     elements
   </ul>
   <p>And on the URL:
   <ul>
    <li>With <code>?full</code> after the URL starts in slide mode
    <li>With a fragment ID or number starts at that slide: <code>?full#intro</code> or <code>?full#2</code>
   </ul>
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=aspect-ratio1>
   <h1>Fixed aspect ratio (1/2)</h1>
   <p>Slides can either have a fixed aspect ratio or adapt to the
    projector. If the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element has a fixed
    width &amp; height (in em, px, or other unit), b6+ will linearly
    scale it to fit the projector.
   <p>Advantage: The layout is independent of the projector. If the
    content fits in the preview, it fits during projection as
    well. Also absolute positioning on a slide is easier, because you
    know the size of the slide in the chosen units.
   <p>Disadvantage: The aspect ratio may not match the projector and
    there may be some unused space either on the sides or above and
    below the slide.
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=aspect-ratio2>
   <h1>Fixed aspect ratio (2/2)</h1>
   <p>E.g., if you set the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> to 40em by 30em
    (a 4:3 aspect ratio), but the projector is widescreen (16:9),
    there will be black bands on the left and right.
   <p>Note that it is the size of the <em>body</em> that
    counts. Setting a width and height on individual slides does not
    trigger the scaling.
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=progress>
   <h1>Progress bar</h1>
   <p>Any element with <code>class=progress</code> will get a style
    attribute ‘width’ with a value between 0 and 100% corresponding to
    the advancement of the slide show: When there are <var>m</var>
    slides and slide <var>n</var> is displayed, the value is <var>n/m
    * 100%</var>.
   <p>There may be any number of such elements.
   <p>That is all the script does. It is up to the style sheet to set
    other properties (height, location, color…) The simple.css style sheet
    makes the progress element into a thin red line along the top of
    the slide.
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=slidenum>
   <h1>Current slide number</h1>
   <p>If there are elements with <code>class=slidenum</code>, their
    content will be set to the number of the slide that is currently
    displayed, as a decimal number:
   <p>Currently showing slide ▶<span class=slidenum>(none)</span>◀
   <p>There may be any number of such elements. All of them will have
    the same content.
   <p>It is up to the style sheet to style and position such
    elements. The simple.css style does nothing with them. (It uses CSS
    counters to number slides instead.)
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=numslides>
   <h1>Total number of slides</h1>
   <p>Any elements with <code>class=numslides</code> will have their
    content replaced by the total number of slides, as a decimal
    number.
   <p>E.g., this slide show has ▶<span class=numslides>??</span>◀
    slides.
   <p>There may any number of such elements.
   <p>It is up to the style sheet to style and postion such
    elements. The simple.css style does nothing with such elements.
   <p>Note: The slides are not counted until you enter slide mode.
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=incremental>
   <h1>Incremental display with class=incremental</h1>
   <p>If an element has <code>class=incremental</code>
    or <code>class=overlay</code>, its children will be displayed one
    at a time. The keys (space, arrow keys), clicks or gestures that
    normally advance to the next slide instead cause the next child to
    be displayed, until all of them are visible, after which the
    navigation continues to the next slide. Example:
   <ul class=incremental>
    <li>Actually,
    <li>the script just sets classes <code>visited</code> and <code>active</code>,
    <li>the style sheet determines whether they are visible, highlighted, etc.
   </ul>
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=next>
   <h1>Incremental display with class=next</h1>
   <p>Incremental display can also be done by
    setting <code>class=next</code> on all elements that should be
    unveiled one by one. Example
   <ul>
    <li class=next>The first item is visible first.
    <li class=next>The second becomes visible next.
    <li>The third item, without <code>class=next</code>, is always visible.
    <li class=next>And then the fourth.
   </ul>
   <p>In this case the elements don't have to be children
    of the same parent.
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=other>
    <h1>Other features</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically sets <code>class=framed</code> on
	the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> when running
	inside <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>
	or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> (allows styling)
      <li>Automatically adds <code>target=_parent</code> to
	all <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements when running
	inside <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>
	or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> (makes hyperlinks work)
      <li>Adding ‘?static’ or ‘?full&amp;static’ to the URL disables
	navigation between slides
    </ul>
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=navigation>
   <h1>Navigation</h1>
   <table>
    <tbody>
     <tr><th>‘A’, double click, 3-finger touch <td>Enter slide mode
     <tr><th>‘A’, esc, 3-finger touch <td>Leave slide mode
     <tr><th>→, ↓, spacebar, left click* <td>Next slide or incremental element
     <tr><th>page down, swipe left <td>Next slide

   <h1>The simple.css style sheet</h1>
   <p><a href="simple.css" >simple.css</a> contains style rules for
    slide mode, index mode and for printing.
   <p>Here are examples and a manual.
  </section>



  <section class="slide slide-in" id="lists">
   <h1>Lists</h1>
   <p>An example of a numbered list:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Potatoes</li>
    <li>Onions and olives</li>
   </ol>
   <p>An example of an unordered list:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>North pole</li>
    <li>East pole</li>
   </ul>
  </section>



  <section class="slide move-left" id="elements">
   <h1>Some elements</h1>
   <p>Words can be given a <strong>strong emphasis</strong>, which
    makes them appear in bold</p>
   <p>The <em>normal emphasis</em> has a highlighter effect.</p>
   <p>Code looks like this: <code>if (a) return b;</code></p>
   <p class="note">This is an example of a note, in a smaller font</p>
  </section>



  <section class=slide id=in-place>
   <h1>Elements updated in-place</h1>
   <p>Combining class=incremental with class=in-place
     yields elements that are displayed one by one, with each one
     replacing the previous. Example:
   <ol class="incremental in-place">
     <li>First element
     <li>The second replaces the first<br>
       until it itself is replaced
     <li>The third replaces the second.
   </ol>
   <p class=note>(class=overlay is an alias for class=incremental.)

   <h2>Writing slides</h2>

   <p>Here are some instructions for writing slides with the
    simple.css style sheet.

   <h3>Slides</h3>

   <p>Each slide is a <strong>section</strong>
    element<sup><a href="#note1" >*</a></sup> with a class
    of <strong >slide</strong>:</p>

   <pre>&lt;section class="slide">
  ... slide content here...
&lt;/section></pre>

   <p>Inside the slides, use normal HTML elements (<strong>p, ul,
    em,</strong> etc.).</p>

   <p class="note" id="note1">*) Note for advanced users: Although not
    shown in this template, it is in fact possible to use other
    elements than <strong>section</strong>. One common choice is
    <strong>div.</strong></p>

   <h3>Slides in alternative formats</h3>

   <p>Instead of enclosing every slide in an element with a class
    of <strong>slide</strong>, it is also possible to use the old
    convention from <a href="../#slidemaker" >Slidemaker</a> and just
    start each slide with an <strong>h1</strong>. Everything until the
    next <strong>h1</strong> will make up one slide.</p>

   <p>And another alternative is to set the CSS property
    ‘page-break-before: always’ on each element that starts a new
    slide.</p>

   <h3>Slide numbers</h3>

   <p>If a slide should <em>not</em> show the slide number, add the
    class <strong>clear</strong>:</p>

   <pre>&lt;section class="slide clear">
  ... slide content here...
&lt;/section></pre>

   <h3>Title slides (cover slides)</h3>

   <p>For cover slides (the title slide or separator slides between
    parts of a presentation), add a class <strong>cover</strong>. You
    can combine <strong>cover</strong>
    and <strong>clear</strong>. E.g.:</p>

   <pre>&lt;section class="slide cover clear">
  &lt;h1>My presentations&lt;h1>
  &lt;address>Peter W. Slidemaker&lt;/address>
&lt;/section></pre>

   <h3>Illustrations on the left or right</h3>

   <p>Slides with narrower text and an illustration on the left can be
    made by adding the class <strong>side</strong> to the
    slide. Inside the slide there should be exactly one element that
    also has a class of <strong>side</strong> (an image or some other
    element):</p>

   <pre>&lt;section class="slide side">
  &lt;img src="..." alt="..." class="side">
  ... slide content here...
&lt;/section></pre>

   <p>The side element will occupy the
    left <span class="num">1/3</span> of the slide and the rest of the
    content the right <span class="num">2/3</span>.</p>

   <p>To put the image on the right instead, add
    class <strong>right</strong> (which may be abbreviated
    to <strong>r</strong>):</p>

   <pre>&lt;section class="slide side r">
  &lt;img src="..." alt="..." class="side">
  ... slide content here...
&lt;/section></pre>

   <h3>Progress bar</h3>

   <p>If you want a progress bar during the slide presentation, add an
    empty <strong>div</strong> with a class
    of <strong>progress</strong>. It can be put before the first slide
    or after the last, but there should be at most one such element in
    the file:</p>

   <pre>&lt;div class="progress">&lt;/div></pre>

   <p>The progress bar will show as a thin red line along the top of
    the slides. Its length increases from zero on the first slide to
    100% on the last.</p>

   <h3>Incremental display</h3>

   <p>To progressively reveal elements on a slide, put a class
    of <strong>next</strong> on all elements that should not be
    visible right away. They will become visible one by one as you
    press the space bar or an arrow key. E.g.:</p>

   <pre>&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>This item is visible when the slide appears&lt;/li>
  &lt;li class="next">This item is not immediately visible&lt;/li>
  &lt;li class="next">This is the third item to appear&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p class="next">This is the last element to appear&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>If all children of an element should be revealed individually
    (e.g., all items in a list), you can also put
    class <strong>incremental</strong> on their parent:</p>

   <pre>&lt;ol class=incremental&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;This appears first&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This appears next&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And then this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</pre>

   <h3>Two columns</h3>

   <p>To put elements side by side in two columns, make an element
    (a <strong>section, ul</strong> or any other element) with
    class <strong>columns</strong>. The first child of that element
    will be put in the left column, the second child in the right
    column. If there are more children, the third will be in the left
    column again, the fourth in the right, etc.</p>

   <pre>&lt;ul class="columns">
  &lt;li>First goes on the left&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>Second goes on the right&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></pre>

   <h3>Small text</h3>

   <p>Less important text can be shown in a smaller font by giving it
    a class of <strong>note</strong>:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p class="note">Note that this is harder to read&lt;/p></pre>

   <h3>Automatic line numbering</h3>

   <p>Pre-formatted text (in a <strong>pre</strong>) can be given line
    numbers by adding the class <strong>numbered</strong>:</p>

   <pre>&lt;pre class="numbered"></pre>

   <p>No more than 20 lines will be numbered. (In the normal font
    size, a slide fits 13 lines.)</p>

   <h3>3×3 Grid</h3>

   <p>It is possible to treat the slide as a 3×3 grid and put elements
    in the four corners, in the middle of each edge, or in the center
    of the slide. This is done by giving the elements a class
    of <strong>place</strong>. On its own, <strong>place</strong> puts
    the element in the center. By adding classes <strong>top, right,
    bottom</strong> and <strong>left</strong> the element can be
    placed in one of the eight other positions.</p>

   <pre>&lt;div class="place">Put this in the center&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="place bottom">Put this bottom center&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="place top right">In the top right corner&lt;/div></pre>

   <p>The direction classes can also be abbreviated to <strong>t, r,
    b</strong> and <strong>l</strong>.</p>

   <h3>Image overlays (background images)</h3>

   <p>To put an image behind the text of a slide, use
    an <strong>img</strong> with a class
    of <strong>cover</strong>:</p>

   <pre>&lt;img class="cover" src="..." alt="..."></pre>

   <p>The image will be stretched to fill the whole of the text area.
    If the image doesn't fit exactly (wrong aspect ratio), the image
    will be cropped.</p>

   <p>With a class of <strong>fit</strong> instead
    of <strong>cover</strong>, the image will be scaled but without
    cropping. Instead there may be white bands on the sides or
    above/below the image, if it doesn't fit exactly.</p>

   <pre>&lt;img class="fit" src="..." alt="..."></pre>

   <p>This works both for normal slides and title slides (slides with
    a class of <strong>cover</strong>). The logo on the right is not
    obscured by the image.</p>

   <h3>Slide transitions</h3>

   <p>By default, each slide just replaces the previous one, but there
    are several predefined slide transitions. You can set a transition
    on the <strong>body</strong> element to apply it to all
    slides:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body class="fade-in"&gt;</pre>

   <p>Or you can set it on individual slides, to apply only to the
    transition between that slide and the next. (I.e., it doesn't
    determine how the slide appears, but how it
    <em>disappears.</em>)</p>

   <pre>&lt;section class="slide wipe-left"&gt;</pre>

   <p>You can set both a global transition and local ones. The global
    transition applies to slides that do not have an explicit
    transition set locally.</p>

   <dl>
    <dt>fade-in</dt>
    <dd>The new slide appears faint at first and gets more opaque
     until it completely obscures the previous slide.</dd>

    <dt>slide-in</dt>
    <dd>The new slide moves in from the left, while the previous slide
     moves back to the left.</dd>

    <dt>move-left</dt>
    <dd>The new slides move in from the right while the old slide
     moves out to the left.</dd>

    <dt>move-up</dt>
    <dd>The old slide moves up and the new slide moves in from the
     bottom.</dd>

    <dt>flip-up</dt>
    <dd>A 3D effect: the bottom of the old slide is lifted up and the
     slide is turned over to reveal the new slide on its back
     side.</dd>

    <dt>flip-left</dt>
    <dd>Another 3D effect, but in this case the right side of the
     slide is lifted up and the slide is flipped over to the left,
     revealing the new slide on the back side.</dd>

    <dt>center-out</dt>
    <dd>A small circle appears in the middle of the old slide that
     reveals the new slide. The circle grows until it covers the whole
     slide.</dd>

    <dt>wipe-left</dt>
    <dd>The new slide moves in from the right, until it covers the old
     slide.</dd>

    <dt>zigzag-left</dt>
    <dd>A zigzag pattern moves in from the right. To the left is the
     old slide, to the right the new one.</dd>

    <dt>zigzag-right</dt>
    <dd>A zigzag pattern moves in from the left. To the left is the
     new slide, to the right the old one.</dd>

    <dt>cut-in</dt>
    <dd>The new slide moves in from the top left and covers the old
     slide.</dd>
   </dl>

   <h3>Accessibility</h3>

   <p>When you present while using a screen reader, you cannot use the
   screen reader's usual keystrokes to navigate, only
   the <a href="#keystrokes">keystrokes defined by the b6+ script</a>.
   However, the screen reader will speak each slide as soon as it
   appears. The script creates an element with
   attributes <strong>role=region</strong>
   and <strong>aria-live=assertive</strong> for that purpose.</p>

   <p>When you leave slide mode, the screen reader will
   say ‘stopped’. To make it say something else (e.g., because you
   want a different language than English), create an element with
   role=region and aria-live=assertive yourself and put the text to
   speak in it. E.g.:</p>

   <pre>&lt;section role="region" aria-live="assertive"&gt;
  <span lang=fr>Terminé.</span>
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>

   <h2 id="presenting">Presenting</h2>

   <h3 id="keystrokes">Mouse gestures and keystrokes</h3>

   <p>To present the slides, load them into a browser that supports
   JavaScript and CSS and then press the <strong>A</strong> key or
   double-click on a slide or touch the screen with three fingers (on
   certain devices).</p>

   <p>Navigate though the slides by clicking the left mouse button,
   pressing the spacebar, the arrow keys or Page-up/Page-Down. The
   Home and End keys jump to the first, resp. last
   slide. <strong>F1</strong> toggles full screen mode. The <strong>?
   (question mark)</strong> key shows a list of available
   commands.</p>

   <p>To exit the presentation, press the <strong>Esc</strong>
   key.</p>

   <p>See the slide <a href="#navigation" >‘Navigation’</a> for a list
   of key strokes.</p>

   <h3 id="second-window">Using two screens or two windows</h3>

   <p>b6+ can open a second window to preview the
   current and next slides and show notes. If you have two screens
   that can show different content (e.g., your computer's screen and a
   projector), you can thus present the slides on one screen, and see
   the current and next slides, and any notes, on the other.</p>

   <p>Open the second window by pressing the ‘2’ key while in slide
   mode. (If it creates a tab, drag it out of the tab bar to make it a
   window.) Every time you go to a new slide, this second window will
   scroll to show the same slide (with incremental elements already
   expanded). If you make the window large enough, you can also see
   the next slide, and any notes you put under the slides.</p>

   <p>Note: If you reload the slides, the script forgets that the
   second window exists and thus will not synchronize it. Just press
   ‘2’ again and it will reconnect to the second window.</p>

   <h3 id="full">Starting in slide mode</h3>

   <p>Add ‘?full’ at the end of the URL (but before any fragment ID)
     to open the slides in slide mode instead of index mode.</p>

   <p>To open in slide mode at a specific slide, add ‘?full’ and the
     ID or the number of the slide, e.g., <a
     href="?full#place">Overview.html?full#place</a> or <a
     href="?full#place">Overview.html?full#25</a>.

   <h3 id="hidemouse">Hiding the mouse pointer</h3>

   <p>When you don't want the mouse pointer to remain on the screen in
    slide mode, add the class <strong>hidemouse</strong> on
    the <strong>body</strong> element. If the mouse does not move for
    5 seconds, the pointer is made invisible. It comes back as soon as
    the mouse is moved.</p>

   <pre>&lt;body class="hidemouse"&gt;</pre>

   <p>You can also set a different timeout in seconds. E.g, to set a
    short timeout of 1.5 seconds:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body class="hidemouse=1.5"&gt;</pre>

   <h3 id="noclick">Ignore mouse clicks</h3>

   <p>Normally, a mouse click anywhere on a slide (other than on a
    hyperlink or form element) has the effect of advancing to the next
    slide or incremental element. If you don't want that, add the
    class <strong>noclick</strong> on the <strong>body</strong>
    element.</p>

   <h2 id="embedding">Embedding slides in other documents</h2>

   <p>You can embed a single slide in another document with the help
     of an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>
     element. To avoid that a keypress or click on that slide
     accidentally changes the slide, you can disable navigation
     between slides and switching to index mode: add
     ‘?full&amp;static’ at the end of the URL, followed by the ID of
     the desired slide. E.g.: <code>&lt;object
     data="Overview.html?full&amp;static#place">…&lt;/object></code></p>

   <p>Adding ‘?static’ on its own to the URL is also possible: It
     shows all slides in index mode and disables switching to slide
     mode.</p>
